# Colt Steele Coding Challenge #1

## Stepper Form using Native JavaScript

I spent way more time on trying to make this look cool than I should have. However, I think it demonstrates the general theme of what was asked from the challenge. Even if I do want to go back and re-do it all again.

Known Issues:

* Scroll bar appears at the bottom in Microsoft Edge
  * Didn't test it in Firefox, but it looks great in Chrome!
* Tabbing through the fields creates a weird half scroll effect
  * I tried to fix it. My brain was starting to hurt
* Probably a bunch of redundant code
  * For sure in the CSS
  * Probably could clean up some of the event listener logic as well
